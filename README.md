# Binomial-distribution
The Binomial distribution gives the probability for x successes in a sequence of N independent Bernoulli trials, when the probability of success in each trial equals p.
The parameters are:
- N , Number of trials which is known
- P , probability of success in each trial 
### Conditions for a binomial experiment
- The experiment is repeated for a fixed number of trials
- Each trial is independent of other trials
- Only two possible outcomes; success or failure
- Probability of a success P(S) is the same for each trial
- The random variable x counts the number of successful trials
